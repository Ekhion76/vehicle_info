# FiveM VEHICLE INFO (STANDALONE)

## A script made for the purpose of helping development

The script consolidates information retrieved through FiveM natives and displays it above the vehicle.
Handling, fuel tank, body health, doors, door locks, tire condition, owner and anything else you include!
It's a small, simple, standalone script :)

## Use:
It starts and stops with the /vehinfo command (toggle)
